This project simply makes use of the turtle library.The game is that the user has to make a bet on a random turtle based on color that it will win the race.
i created the list of colors to assign to each turtle.
then i made another list to store turtles.
I made use of for and range to make turtles and assign the initial position to each of the turtles.
Then i used the while loop and assigned the speed to each turtle randomly using random module.
